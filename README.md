Usage instructions
------------------

1. Create a note  
  To create a note, right-click at the location where the note should show up
  and select "Create note...". A new note appears at this location and   
2. Move and resize a note

 handler. Click on it and hold the mouse button down to move the note around.  
 While hovering over the note, a resize handler appears in the lower right corner
 of the note.
 
3. Edit a note
 You can easily edit a note by double clicking on it. To indicate, that the note 
 is in edit mode, the border color and the color of the drag and resize handlers 
 change to red.  
 You can use Markdown to format the text.  
 Click somewhere on the web site to save the changes.
 
4. Delete a note
  Select "Delete" from the note's menu  

About "locations" / scope
-------------------------
 
 A web site might exist of several sub pages. By default, a note only exists on
 the page it was created. But this can be changed and a note show up on any page
 that lies in a certain path.
 
 Example:
 Lets assume I create a note on this page, http://github.com/fkling/floatnotes.
 Later, I decide that this note should be displayed on any of my projects pages.
 That means the note should show up for any page which URL starts with 
 http://github.com/fkling/.
 Or maybe I even to to show a note on any site of github.com.
 
 To change the location of a note, click "Settings" in the notes menu and select another location.
